/*
  todo1: what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

// Asynchronous is a non-blocking , it means the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously . But Synchronous is a blocking , so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it ! Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next ...
// So the most specific diffrence is about how they execute tasks !
